# OWASP Top 10 Categories and Associated Vulnerabilities ~

## What is the OWASP Top 10?

The OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10 is a standard awareness document that highlights the ten most critical security risks to web applications. Understanding these vulnerabilities is essential for both defending against attacks and understanding how attackers exploit weaknesses. Here's a detailed look at the OWASP Top 10 and the associated vulnerabilities:

1. **Injection**
   - **SQL Injection**: Manipulating SQL queries to execute arbitrary commands.
   - **NoSQL Injection**: Attacking NoSQL databases by injecting untrusted data.
   - **OS Command Injection**: Executing arbitrary commands on the host OS.
   - **LDAP Injection**: Modifying LDAP queries to alter application behavior.
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
   - **CRLF Injection**: Injecting Carriage Return and Line Feed characters.

2. **Broken Authentication**
   - **Weak Passwords**: Easily guessable passwords allowing unauthorized access.
   - **Credential Stuffing**: Using stolen credentials to gain access.
   - **Session Fixation**: Hijacking a valid user session.
   - **Password Reuse**: Reusing passwords across multiple sites.
   - **Brute Force Attacks**: Trying many passwords to gain access.

3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - **Unencrypted Data Transmission**: Exposing data during transmission.
   - **Improper Key Management**: Weak or exposed encryption keys.
   - **Insecure Storage**: Storing sensitive data in an unprotected manner.
   - **Data Leakage in Logs**: Exposing sensitive data through logs.

4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**
   - **XML Injection**: Inserting malicious XML content.
   - **DTD Injection**: Manipulating Document Type Definitions.
   - **XXE (Exfiltration of Data)**: Extracting data using XML external entities.

5. **Broken Access Control**
   - **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher privileges than allowed.
   - **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: Accessing unauthorized resources.
   - **Forceful Browsing**: Accessing parts of a site not intended for the user.
   - **Directory Traversal**: Accessing files outside the web root.

6. **Security Misconfiguration**
   - **Default Configurations**: Using insecure default settings.
   - **Verbose Error Messages**: Revealing sensitive information in errors.
   - **Open Cloud Storage**: Exposing data in publicly accessible storage.
   - **Unpatched Systems**: Running outdated and vulnerable software.

7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - **Reflected XSS**: Injecting scripts that are reflected off a web server.
   - **Stored XSS**: Injecting scripts that are stored on the target server.
   - **DOM-Based XSS**: Modifying the DOM environment in the victim's browser.

8. **Insecure Deserialization**
   - **Remote Code Execution**: Executing arbitrary code via deserialized data.
   - **Data Tampering**: Altering serialized data to change application behavior.
   - **Replay Attacks**: Resending serialized data to repeat actions.
   - **Injection Attacks via Deserialized Data**: Injecting malicious data during deserialization.

9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**
   - **Outdated Libraries**: Using old libraries with known flaws.
   - **Vulnerable Frameworks**: Relying on insecure frameworks.
   - **Insecure Third-Party Modules**: Using untrusted external code.
   - **Legacy Code**: Running outdated and unsupported code.

10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**
    - **Lack of Audit Logs**: Not maintaining logs for security events.
    - **Unmonitored Log Files**: Ignoring log files and alerts.
    - **Poor Incident Response**: Failing to respond to security breaches effectively.
    - **Undetected Security Breaches**: Missing signs of ongoing attacks.

## Why Should Hackers Care?

Understanding the OWASP Top 10 is crucial for hackers as it provides insight into the most common vulnerabilities found in web applications. Exploiting these weaknesses can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and more. By mastering these vulnerabilities, hackers can improve their skills in both offensive and defensive security.
